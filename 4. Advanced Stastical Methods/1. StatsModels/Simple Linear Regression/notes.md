Decomposition of Variability - ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) -> SST = SSR + SSE

OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) - Linear regression method used to estimate unknown parameters in model. Method relies on minimizing SSR between actual and predicted values.

R-squared = SSR/SST (variability explained by regression / total variability of dataset) - Measures how much variability(%) is explained by regression i.e. Goodness of fit of model.
