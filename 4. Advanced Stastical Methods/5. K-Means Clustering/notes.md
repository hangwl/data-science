How do we perform clustering in practice?\
K-Means Clustering is the most popular clustering method

How it works (imagine 2D scatterplot):
1. Choose k number of clusters
2. Specify the cluster seeds (a starting centroid chosen at random or specified by the data scientist based on prior knowledge on the data)
3. Assign each point to a centroid (colour all points based on their euclidean distance)
4. Adjust the centroids
5. Repeat iterations of steps 3-4 if necessary
