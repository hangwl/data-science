Cluster Analysis is a multivariate statistical technique that groups observations on the basis of some of their features or variables they are described by. Intuitively, observations in a dataset can be divided into different groups and sometimes this is very useful.

e.g. Clustering of Countries by Geographic proximity

The goal of clustering is to maximize the similarity of observations within a cluster and maximize the dissimilarity between clusters.

Cluster Analysis:
1. Identifying Clustering Problems
2. Performing Cluster Analysis
3. Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters
4. Identifying the Appropriate Features
5. Interpreting the Results

Main Python Modules used:
- sklearn
- pandas

Applications of Clustering:
1. Market Segmentation
2. Image Segmentation

Difference between Classification and Clustering:
- Linear and logistic regression = Regression and classification in ML context, which are approaches used in supervised learning where we primarily handle labelled data
- Clustering on the other hand deals with unlabelled data, through unsupervised learning
  
- Classification is about predicting an output category given input data
- Clustering is about grouping data points together based on similarities among them and differences from others

Math Prerequisites for Cluster Analysis:
- Euclidean Distance between 2 Data Points
- Centroid - Mean position of a group of points
