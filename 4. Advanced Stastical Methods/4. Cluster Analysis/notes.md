Cluster Analysis is a multivariate statistical technique that groups observations on the basis of some of their features or variables they are described by. Intuitively, observations in a dataset can be divided into different groups and sometimes this is very useful.

e.g. Clustering of Countries by Geographic proximity

The goal of clustering is to maximize the similarity of observations within a cluster and maximize the dissimilarity between clusters.

Cluster Analysis:
1. Identifying Clustering Problems
2. Performing Cluster Analysis
3. Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters
4. Identifying the Appropriate Features
5. Interpreting the Results

Main Python Modules used:
- sklearn
- pandas
