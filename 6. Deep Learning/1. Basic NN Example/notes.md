simple ML algorithm

We will be building a model and feeding it with inputs.\
The algorithm will be expected to learn the underlying relationship of the data.\

Here are the steps:
1. Import relevant Python libraries
    np, plt, Axes3D 

2. Generate random data to train with (Rerunning the code will always yield different inputs, but the model will remain the same)
   
3. Create the targets

4. Plot the training data (The point is to see that there is a strong trend that our model should learn to reproduce)

5. Create weights

6. Create biases

7. Set a learning rate

8. Train the model

9. Print weights and biases and see if we have worked correctly

10. Plot last outputs vs targets
